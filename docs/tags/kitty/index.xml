      <description>I&amp;#39;ve been using the same terminal emulator (rxvt and latter urxvt) since around 2008. I was pretty happy with the setup, running it with urxvtd/urxvtc until I tried to play around with family fonts including powerline symbols, and certain unicode characters which I never managed to get to display correctly.
 Additionally, at some point I added a second monitor to my home setup, with a higher resolution (2560x1440) than the older one (1920x1080) and finding a font family/size combination that rendered properly in both resolutions was rather problematic, so I was open to try alternatives.</description>
