The book main thesis proposes a new way to think and approach gender related inequality issues.

The author defines two terms: _ingressive_ and _congressive_ behavior as the two dimensions
to explain social behavior, and how gender is taken frequently as proxy (in a biased  and limited way)
for the character traits and properties of these classes.

I liked this book. Very interesting and well written. I found the proposed ingressive/congressive
model offers a better framework than pure gender based approaches to try to design and implement
solutions of gender based inequality.
