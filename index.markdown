# Overview

Static sites are fast, secure, easy to deploy, and manageable using version
control.

Hakyll is a [Haskell](http://haskell.org) library for generating static sites,
mostly aimed at small-to-medium sites and personal blogs. It is written in a
very configurable way and uses an [xmonad](http://xmonad.org)-like DSL for
configuration.
