# Welcome

This is my personal web space, brought to you thanks to [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
and [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).

Briefly explained, here you can find the following:

* Resume: A recollection of my working experience and the different projects I
worked on. As the list went growing and and I kepth trying to cut it enough to
present everything in a couple of pages in my traditional CV document, 
I thought of having a more detailed story somewhere in case anyone should
be interested.

* Blog: A place to collect ramblings and musings without any commitment to
maintain any frequency of publication. Book reviews can be expected.
